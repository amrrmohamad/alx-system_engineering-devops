## 🧑‍💻 Overview

DevOps is a set of practices that bridge the gap between development and operations teams, enhancing collaboration, automation, and efficiency throughout the software lifecycle. This repository explores key DevOps tools and methodologies, including Continuous Integration (CI), Continuous Delivery (CD), infrastructure as code, containerization, and monitoring.

## ✨ Features

This repository covers the following key areas of DevOps:

- **Version Control**: An introduction to using Git for tracking code changes and collaborating across teams.
- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Automating code integration and testing using tools like Jenkins and GitHub Actions.
- **Continuous Delivery (CD)**: Streamlining deployment pipelines with tools like CircleCI, Travis CI, and Azure DevOps.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Managing infrastructure using code with tools like Terraform and AWS CloudFormation.
- **Containerization**: Packaging applications with Docker and managing containers with Kubernetes.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Implementing monitoring and logging solutions with tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK Stack.
- **Security in DevOps**: An introduction to DevSecOps practices for integrating security into the DevOps workflow.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before diving into the repository, make sure you have the following tools installed:

- **Git**: For version control and collaboration.
- **Docker**: For containerization.
- **Terraform** (or a similar IaC tool): For managing infrastructure.
- **Jenkins** or **GitHub Actions**: For continuous integration and delivery.
- **Kubernetes**: For container orchestration.
  
You can verify the installation of these tools by running:

```bash
git --version
docker --version
terraform --version
```
